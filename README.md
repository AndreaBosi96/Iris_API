# Iris_API
Projct with a simple classificator as backend, which serves as an API for a frontend page

## Why?
I created this project to have a simple template for simple machine learning projects. 

- A predictor was built with a sci-kit learn logistic regression. 
- The model is built and trained when the server is started (for heavy models, it could be saved and imported)
- A flask server is used as backend, to provied a class prediction using the previous model when the API is called.
- A very simple front-end page was built for user's inputs and to show the prediction results.
